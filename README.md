## Bookshelf Theme

A warm, soothing theme reminiscent of old library shelves and leather bound books. The theme's goals are to have good contrast without harsnhess, be easy to look at for extended periods, and maintain a comforting, circadian-rhythm-saving feeling of visual warmth.

Light (Original)

Currently, the theme contains a single light version; I hope to add more variants.

This is still in progress, but should be fine for front end development work. Generic testing has been done against the langs in the /demo folder, but more demos and more tests should be done.
