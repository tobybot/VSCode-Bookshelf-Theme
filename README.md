## Bookshelf Theme v 0.0.1

**Note: Not ready for prime time - need to test against more langs - but should be fine for PHP/front end dev work.**

A warm, soothing theme reminiscent of old library shelves and leather bound books. The theme's goals are to have good contrast without harsnhess, be easy to look at for extended periods, and maintain a comforting, circadian-rhythm-saving feeling of visual warmth.

I hope to add more variants. Currently, the theme contains a single Light variant.
